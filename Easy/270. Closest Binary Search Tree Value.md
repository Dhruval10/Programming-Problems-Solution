[270. Closest Binary Search Tree Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value/)
```
Given the root of a binary search tree and a target value, return the value in the BST that is closest to the target.

Example 1:
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286
Output: 4

Example 2:
Input: root = [1], target = 4.428571
Output: 1

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
0 <= Node.val <= 10^9
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
```
